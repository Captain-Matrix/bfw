this project is under active development

bfw is a firewall that generates rules based on traffic observation.

other than the obvious, I have planned lua scripting support and web interface to monitor live traffic.
it utilizes libnetfilter_queues, so you will need that library and kernel support in order to build and run it.
other dependencies include libtinfo(comes with ncurses) and a nice dose of patience :)

to make program just type make.
at the moment please build processlog program with the following command line , feature not integrated to main program yet:

make processlog

latest stable source for libnetfilter queue can be found at http://www.iptables.org/projects/libnetfilter_queue/downloads.html
